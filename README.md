# Ï‰-tuner

Guitar tuning web app. Tuning your guitar shouldn't require you to carry around special equipment. A
computer or phone with a decent microphone ought to be enough. This app listens to your guitar string
in real time and computes its pitch, pointing you in the right direction to correct it.
